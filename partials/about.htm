                          <p>My interest in Photography started at age 8 when I was presented with a disposable Kodak point and shoot camera. With this little toy I learnt my first lessons in composition, as there were simply no other options on the camera. After many years of film and slide photography I progressed, like many, to digital and the boundaries of possibility expanded infinitely.

                              I find many of my photographic inspirations in the journeys I make as a mountaineering guide and climber, giving me ample action and landscape opportunities. Iâ€™ve also enjoyed creating photo collections of newborns and weddings. I thrive at the chance to explore new avenues of artistic expression and I now regularly shoot HD video on my mountain adventures, and enjoy the editing and rendering challenges within the moving story.
